    " - Fantasy Football offers a lot of interesting data science tasks/problems to explore. One of those is predicting players a fantasy owner should choose.\n",
    " - Choosing the right players is crucial for being competitive in a league.\n",
    " - Aside from choosing a player based on performance (which has a more direct relationship with points, modeling  potential for injury by using past player injured reserve (ir) data could inform owners about players to avoid\n",
    " - One approach is to represent a players' career as a vector with each index in the vector representing a single season and each value representing whether the player was healthy or an injury that caused the player to be placed on IR.\n",

    "<font size=4>or this analysis, I'll be focusing on the \"Who should I chose?\" question.  My long-term desire is to build a reasonably accurate predictive model to aide in choosing a player for an upcoming season. That simple question becomes very complex when considering the variables needed to predict a player's future success.  You may think that a prior season's performance is a good predictor of the future but we could reason that modeling future performance based on prior statistics is most likely a simplistic representation of the complex real-world. But what other factors influence a player's performance?  Here, I would make a distinction between intrinsic (player-dependent) and extrinsic (outside of the player) factors. Beyond past performance, I would suggest that intrinsic factors could include age, experience, or even potentially height/weight as examples.  Extrinsic features could include a player's coach, the talent surrounding them, even the franchise they belong to.  We can't faithfully model all of the real-world factors, but we can try our best to understand what factors have the greatest influence on a player's performance and model these.  This concept is called large-world uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>\n",
    "In my question of \"Whom should I choose?\" and brainstorming the intrinic/extrinsic factors I found a bias in my own thinking. I was seeking out the obvious - variables that discretely generate points (touchdowns, rushing yards, catches, etc. and are positively correlated to fantasy points). I became a little more sophisticated and reasoned that age might play a role as it's been suggested and mostly observed that as a player ages, their performance is likely to diminish; a widely observed relationship in sports is that age has a negative correlation to production.  Then the most obvious thing finally dawned on me - what about injuries?  If a player is injured, they can't play.  If they can't play, they can't generate points and that could have just as much of an impact on a fantasy team than using some other variable. So, if I choose a high performing player (we'll call them \"A\")  and they get injured and are out several games, than their higher performances are diluted over the span of the season as they aren't generating points during the games they're injured (ie their mean-season performance is decreased).  Now, the prospect of grabbing a player who is a moderate performer (\"B\") but stays healthy across the season might not seem like such a bad choice.  I'll point out that this is not black and white scenario - it might just be that A won your team games for a few weeks whereas playing B in those same weeks wouldn't have led to the same result so it's possible the risk of selecting A if there was a prior belief that they would get injured might still be worth it, but in general, especially during a draft, you don't have any certainty about future performance - and therefore, your limited to predicting the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4><p>  \n",
    "It's reasonable to assume, however, that an owner would want to avoid prolonged injuries as a risk-mitigations strategy for earlier selection where the very best players are presumed to still be available. Considering other owners will be selecting the highest expected performers early in the draft, owners choosing players who are high performers and less at risk of prolonged injury ensures that they'll be able to stay competitive. Therefore, in asking the question, \"Whom should I choose?\", it's important to ask an intersecting question of \"Whom is likely to be injured?\".  \"Injured\" or more generally \"Health\" can be multi-faceted (players could have minor injuries that take them out of a game, long-term injuries that require them to be sit out a predefined number of weeks with a designation of \"Injured Reserve\", or they could catch covid and sit out of games until they recover).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>\n",
    "In this analysis, I explore this question using the presense/non-presence of a player's stint on Injured Reserve as a proxy for health, as long-term inactivity (from injury) will have a significant impact on fantasy performance.</font><p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4> __Data Representation__ </font><p>\n",
    "For this first attempt, We're going to build a simple model using vector representations of player careers. Our resulting model will be fairly simplistic as it will only be looking at the probability of injury given a sequence of prior injuries (using markov chains).  Real-life is obviously much more nuanced but I love thinking about data in terms of the toolsets I've learned from my courses and experimenting with their application. We'll explore alternative representations and techniques in the future.\n",
