    "<br>\n",
    "<font size=10>M</font><font size=4>y ventures into data science originated (unbeknownst to me at the time) as a desire to formulate a strategy for selecting fantasy football players. If you're unfamiliar with Fantasy Football, it basically boils down to this - you along with several other people (labeled as \"owners\") form a \"league\" choosing real-life NFL players at various positions to form an imaginary team.  Each week, players will play in their real-life NFL games and their statistics, such as yards rushed or passing touchdowns generate \"points\" which are aggregated into point totals for each imaginary team.  There are several different formats to a league, but the one I've come to know and love is called a Head-Head League; you play against another owner's imaginary team and whomever obtains the most points generated by the combination of players for their respective \"teams\" wins the week (and conversely the other owner loses).  The \"season\" coincides with the real NFL season and your resulting record of wins/losses determines your advancement into a playoff period leading eventually to a single champion. As the season progresses, owners have to continually make decisions about which players to \"start\" (capture their performances) vs \"sit\" (ignore their performances). These decisions can be based on prior performance, strength of opponent, health, etc.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>Regarding player selection, this can occur either prior to the season starting and in-season.  Prior to the season, leagues will have \"drafts\" which is an event that allows each owner to build a requisite roster of players. It's assumed you'll be choosing your highest performers in this event (though may not be the case). The risk here is that you're mostly reliant on the past seasons as well as advice from internet/traditional media \"experts\" who at best are running their own models and at worst are using their non-empirical judgements to rank players for public consumption.  Drafts require their own form of strategy forcing owners to balance \"performance\" with \"cost\" all in the midst of \"hype\" - which is the media/fandom's inflation of a player's value based on perceived or expected performance. The higher the hype, the higher the price with the expected result of that player producing excellent results relative to other players who could've been chosen at that time or for the asking price. A reasonable strategy that can lead to success is finding players who perform better than their average draft position (referred to as ADP). The larger the distance between ADP and actual selection, where the former is earlier in the draft than the actual selection, the implied greater value.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>Alternatively, owners can pick-up or trade players when the season is underway and the factors that go into these decisions can be different than in the draft. An owner may select a player (free agent) if they have a favorable matchup for a week or trade for a player they believe will perform better than the one they're giving up for the remainder of the season.  Usually, there's a greater emphasis on selection based on matchup though some factors that go into draft selection can be seen during the season as well.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>The key idea is that as a fantasy owner, your success depends on choosing high-performing players for your team and playing them when they have a higher potential for success (e.g. perhaps their opponent is not good at defending the player's position) OR when the cost of keeping inactive (ie not playing them) is higher than if they were to play. There are quite a number of considerations that go into \"starting\" (playing) a player and all are beyond the scope of this analysis.  However, there are two critical questions to keep in mind when managing a fantasy football:  __Who should I choose?__ and __When should I use them?__.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "<font size=5>__Problem Formulation__</font>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<font size=10>F</font>\n",
    "<font size=4>or this analysis, I'll be focusing on the \"Who should I chose?\" question.  My long-term desire is to build a reasonably accurate predictive model to aide in choosing a player for an upcoming season. That simple question becomes very complex when considering the variables that inform a player's future success.  You may think that a prior season's performance is a good predictor of the future but we could reason that modeling future performance based on prior statistics is most likely a simplistic representation of the complex real-world. But what other factors influence a player's performance?  Here, I would make a distinction between intrinsic (player-dependent) and extrinsic (outside of the player) factors. Beyond past performance, I would suggest that intrinsic factors could include age, experience, or even potentially height/weight as examples.  Extrinsic features could include a player's coach, the talent surrounding them, even the franchise they belong to.  We can't faithfully model all of the real-world factors, but we can try our best to understand what factors have the greatest influence on a player's performance and model these.  This concept is called large-world uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>\n",
    "In my question of \"Who should I choose?\" and brainstorming the intrinic/extrinsic factors I found a bias in my own thinking. I was seeking out the obvious - variables that discretely generate points (touchdowns, rushing yards, catches, etc. and are positively correlated to fantasy points). I got a little more sophisticated and reasoned that age might play a role as it's been suggested and mostly observed that as a player ages, their performance is likely to diminish; age has a negative correlation to production.  Then the most obvious thing finally dawned on me - what about injuries?  If a player is injured, they can't play.  If they can't play, they can't generate points and that could have just as much of an impact on a fantasy team than using some other variable. So, if I choose a high performing player (we'll call them \"A\")  and they get injured and are out several games, than their higher performances are \"decayed\" over the span of the season as they aren't generating points during the games they're injured (ie their mean-season performance is decreased).  Now, the prospect of grabbing a player who is a moderate performer (\"B\") but stays healthy across the season might not seem like such a bad choice.  I'll point out that this is not black and white scenario - it might just be that A won your team games for a few weeks whereas playing B in those same weeks wouldn't have led to the same result so it's possible the risk of selecting A if there was a prior belief that they would get injured might still be worth it, but in general, especially during a draft, you don't have an understanding of future performance - and therefore, your limited to predicting the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>    \n",
    "It's reasonable to assume, however, that an owner would want to avoid prolonged injuries as a risk-mitigations strategy for earlier selection where the very best players are presumed to be available. Considering other owners will be selecting the highest expected performers early in the draft, owners choosing players who are high performers and less at risk of prolonged injury ensures that they'll be able to stay competitive. Therefore, in asking the question, \"Who should I choose?\", it's important to ask an intersecting question of \"Who is likely to be injured?\".  \"Injured\" or more generally \"Health\" can be multi-faceted (players could have minor injuries that take them out of a game, long-term injuries that require them to be sit out a predefined number of weeks with a designation of \"Injured Reserve\", or they could catch covid and sit out of games until they recover).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>\n",
    "In this analysis, I explore this question using the presense/non-presence of a player's stint on Injured Reserve as a proxy for health.</font>\n",

Using only the transaction data will only provide us the seasons in which an IR transaction occurred, but we can't rely on it to account for every season. This is crucial, as we want to represent every season of a player's career (whether there was an injury or not). \n",

Let's imagine Derrick Henry got injured in January '22 as opposed to November '21.  In reality, this wouldn't have an impact on fantasy, but we want to represent that he was on IR and we want to attribute it to the correct season number of his career. Therefore, we need to make some logic choices about season attribution; should we associate the IR to his 6th season as a player or the 7th?  In this (imaginary) case, since it's still part of the '21 season, we should attribute it to season 6 of his careern.  It makes sense then, that we want to associate IR stints with the months 9-12, and 1-2) and any month after then we restart another season.  \n",
