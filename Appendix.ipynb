    "antasy Football is a game of strategy.   Hw boils down to this - you along with several other people (labeled as \"owners\") form a \"league\" choosing real-life NFL players at various positions to form an imaginary team.  Each week, players will play in their real-life NFL games and their statistics, such as yards rushed or passing touchdowns generate \"points\" which are aggregated into point totals for each imaginary team.  There are several different formats to a league, but the one I've come to know and love is called a Head-Head League; you play against another owner's imaginary team (comprised of a list of real players) and whomever obtains the most points generated by the combination of players for their respective \"teams\" wins the week (and conversely the other owner loses).  The \"season\" coincides with the real NFL season and your resulting record of wins/losses determines your advancement into a playoff period leading eventually to a single champion. As the season progresses, owners have to continually make decisions about which players to \"start\" (capture their performances) vs \"sit\" (ignore their performances). These decisions can be based on prior performance, strength of opponent, health, etc.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>Regarding player selection, this can occur either prior to the season starting and in-season.  Prior to the season, leagues will have \"drafts\" which is an event that allows each owner to build a requisite roster of players. It's assumed you'll be choosing your highest performers in this event (though may not be the case). The risk here is that you're mostly reliant on the past seasons as well as advice from internet/traditional media \"experts\" who at best are running their own models and at worst are using their non-empirical judgements to rank players for public consumption.  Drafts require their own form of strategy forcing owners to balance \"performance\" with \"cost\" all in the midst of \"hype\" - which is the media/fandom's inflation of a player's value based on perceived or expected performance. The higher the hype, the higher the price with the expected result of that player producing excellent results relative to other players who could've been chosen at that time or for the asking price. A reasonable strategy that can lead to success is finding players who perform better than their average draft position (referred to as ADP). The larger the distance between ADP and actual selection, where the former is earlier in the draft than the actual selection, the implied greater value.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>Alternatively, owners can pick-up or trade players when the season is underway and the factors that go into these decisions can be different than in the draft. An owner may select a player (free agent) if they have a favorable matchup for a week or trade for a player they believe will perform better than the one they're giving up for the remainder of the season.  Usually, there's a greater emphasis on selection based on matchup though some factors that go into draft selection can be seen during the season as well.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4>The key idea is that as a fantasy owner, your success depends on choosing high-performing players for your team and playing them when they have a higher potential for success (e.g. perhaps their opponent is not good at defending the player's position) OR when the cost of keeping inactive (ie not playing them) is higher than if they were to play. There are quite a number of considerations that go into \"starting\" (playing) a player and all are beyond the scope of this project.  However, there are two critical questions to keep in mind when managing a fantasy football:  __Who should I choose?__ and __When should I use them?__.</font>\n",
